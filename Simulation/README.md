## Grain Accounting Simulation

> Programos tikslas istirti, kuris grudu apskaitos metodas yra geresnis tarp FIFO (first-in, first-out) ir LIFO (last-in, first-out) supirkimo metodu.

- Parameters for simulation are taken from `test.txt` file.
- Program implements queue and stack data structures written from scratch
- These data structures are used to simulate two `FIFO` and `LIFO` methods to find which gives more profit in situation defined by given parameters.
